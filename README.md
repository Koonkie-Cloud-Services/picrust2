# PICRUSt2

The current code and documentation for PICRUSt2 is found here. **Please note that PICRUSt2 is still actively being developed and tested**, so in the meantime we recommend you use [PICRUSt1](http://picrust.github.io/picrust/).

Documentation is found on this [repository's wiki](https://github.com/picrust/picrust2/wiki).

We are planning to release PICRUSt 2 by the end of 2018. It includes these and other improvements:
* Updated pre-calculated files with additional genomes and gene families.
* Allows output of MetaCyc ontology predictions that will be comparable with common shotgun metagenomics outputs.
* Straight-forward running of genome prediction, which will allow users to predict functions for all their study sequences (even those not found in a database).
* Addition of hidden-state prediction algorithms from the ```castor``` R package.
